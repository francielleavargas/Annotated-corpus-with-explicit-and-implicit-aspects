The corpus consist of implicit and explicit annotated aspects for opinion mining and/or sentiment analysis as well as summarization applications. 


WHAT IS IT?


For example, in the review passage “she considered the camera price very expensive”, the consumer employed the term “price” to evaluate an aspect of the camera; however, consumers might also use the terms “cost”, “value”, “investiment”, etc. In addition, consumers may use implicit or explicit aspects to refer to the same aspect, e.g., the sentences “she got calls at the São Francisco river” and “working anywhere” have been employed in actual reviews to evaluate the (implicit) “signal” aspect of a smartphone. It is also interesting to notice that, in some domains, proper names may be employed to refer to the aspects. For instance, the proper names “Sony” and “Nikon” may be used to evaluate the “product brand” aspect of digital cameras.
